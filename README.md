# EarmarkReversal

Convert an [Earmark AST](https://hex.pm/packages/earmark_parser) back to a Markdown string. All the code in this package has been ripped out of the [Livebook](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook) project (specifically the https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook/blob/main/lib/livebook/live_markdown/markdown_helpers.ex) so it can be used as a standalone helper.  No original code has been written for this package, so all credit should go to the original Livebook author [Jonatan KÅ‚osko](https://github.com/jonatanklosko) :clap:

## Usage

```elixir
{:ok, ast, []} = EarmarkParser.as_ast("I just love **bold text**.")
EarmarkReversal.markdown_from_ast(ast)
"I just love **bold text**."
```
